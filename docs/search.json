Of this number, Mr. Hinneh reported that 104, or 37.68% of the candidates were successful, while 172 or 62.32% candidates were unsuccessful.\n34 (32.69%) of the total candidates who passed the Graduate School Aptitude Test are females, while 70 (67.31%) are males.\nThe 2022 Second Entrance results further indicate that 2,098 of the total number of candidates who passed, constituting 44.07% (including females), will be admitted to the sciences.\nCompared to 2021, the highest number of candidates (1,966 which constituted 35.49%) were admitted in the A. Romeo Horton College of Business and Public Administration.\nThe results also record at least thirty-four female candidates making successful passes out of the 104 candidates who wrote the Graduate School Aptitude Test.\nThat number constitutes thirty-four percent (34%) of the total number.\nThe results further state that of 154 candidates who registered for the Law School Aptitude Test, three were absent.\nOf the 151 candidates who wrote the Law School Aptitude Test, the results show that 44 (29.14%) candidates were successful, and 107 (70.86%) were unsuccessful.\nThirty-four (77.27%) of the candidates were males, while ten (22.73%) were females. The CTE results also show that High School Graduates recorded the highest number of successful candidates (4,672), followed by current twelve graders, 62, and 22 candidates from other universities.\nThe overall results indicate that candidates from faith-based schools recorded the highest number of successful candidates, amounting to 1,989 (41.78%) of the total number.\nOf the Fifteen counties, Lofa County, recorded the highest number of successful candidates with a total of 1,047 (21.99%) of the total number. In 2021, Lofa also recorded the highest number, with a total of 1,194 (21.56%) successful candidates.\nWhile the results were being released, Prof. Dr. Julius Julukon Sarwolo Nelson, Jr., said as President of the University of Liberia, the high participation rate in UL’s entrance exam process brings him great joy as well as strong reminders of the challenges at hand.\nPresident Nelson said the 9,602 candidates who sat the Second Entrance joined the over 12,000 candidates who sat the First Entrance to give UL more than 21,000 total candidates who participated in the 2022 entrance exam cycle.\nThe UL President said this trend of heightened interest in the University’s enrollment processes point to changes in the higher education sub-sector which have made tertiary education more affordable and attainable without compromising quality.\n“This is why as managers and administrators of this premier public higher education institution, we are always pleased to see the continuous demonstration of desires by Liberians of various works of life to acquire higher education and build their capacities here at the University of Liberia (Lux In Tenebris),” said President Nelson.\nDr. Nelson explained that the current enrollment is more than 21,000, of whom over 2,000 will be leaving UL during the 103rd Commencement Convocation in May/June this year.\n“Though we are extremely excited as always, to welcome more and more new intakes, we must also ensure that other targeted variables are attained. It is our responsibility to attract the best and brightest students through these processes to ensure that the quality and standard of our brand remain high,” he added.\nHe continued that UL administrators are cognizant of the changing faculty-student ratio, and this is why faculty and staff development is a high priority.\nThe UL President stated that there is also a glaringly urgent need for infrastructure upgrade, maintenance, and construction of new facilities not just to respond to the increasing demand for affordable higher education in Liberia but also to deal with legacy issues on UL campuses.\nLink to access the Entrance Results Dashboard:\nhttps://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Frstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com%2F997522_0f5730b119e645c9a3db087df413c799.html%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0KHNrEv-rQOAsWC4UN7UapoBeLulaJ2zU_XmWSd5386oGtS5MbTtrZhDw%23exam-results&h=AT1I28J5x1A0p-qeN7w3aDJGh_q5SlL7pCRees_3lDq8DpUR0vwF_BcJFNoZRi9H0lq8VM4bhdMCQ-SPMuvsbFocl8YspYGDPnjelW4ksITuxvJXZFIoVNdsizXoL4I_77ZJfpe4FQ&__tn__=-UK-R&c[0]=AT1L_a6u6RqAkRxcRgGuLs7PuQxjaTq5dg1tnHTu2BE3GzkLnL0oG3gGlDp3phXQ5muDanpPimzI5PqIyg2wvZm-x1MCBhyX6zhxQfxmleSqljg7J_n0L3TQHJ769fxYmKkdFPK5uqDhWA80kIBvUtRTE-iEHbIQQttV2uI5UISgPfAJ2csi-aV25SUTPZGzkrtGoGE-_Y-Z.\n\n\n\n",
